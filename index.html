It was founded by actors Jack Black and Kyle Gass, who were members of The Actors' Gang theater company at the time. The duo's name is derived from "tenacious defense", a phrase used by NBA basketball sportscasters Walt Frazier and Marv Albert. In 2000, they signed with Epic Records and the year after released Tenacious D, their debut album featuring a full band, including Dave Grohl on the drums. Their cover of Ronnie James Dio's "The Last in Line" won a Grammy for best heavy metal performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.</p>
